# MyInventory
Sample Android mobile application built in SNHU CS360, upgraded in CS499 Computer Science Capstone.

This repo contains the project files for Android Studio at each stage of development over the course.

## MyInventory_0
Original final project submitted in CS-360.

## MyInventory_1
First enhancement made in CS499, focused on software design and development. The main upgrade here was a UX redesign. Accompanying diagrams and personas are in the 'Design Documents' zip folder.

## MyInventory_2
Second enhancement made in CS499, focused on algorithms and data structures.

## MyInventory_3
Third enhancement made in CS499, focused on databases.

### Known Issues 
When attempting to load these files into Android Studio for viewing, there are many dependency and version issues that could arise. If you come across the notorious 'Cannot find R.': Try Build - clean and rebuild, File - empty the cache and restart, or check Gradle version and known bugs. When all else fails, try import the files individually into a blank Android Studio project.
The database upgrade version requires an emulator with Google Play enabled and a security file to access the database.
This has not been included for obvious reasons. You can use your own from your own firebase account if using this as a base or learning project - it will need to be placed in the base app directory.
If you are a client, interviewer, or collaborator who would like to demo the project in an emulator yourself, I will provide you with security permissions.
